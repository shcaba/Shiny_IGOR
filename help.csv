1,#oto_age_upload,"To find out the relationship between ages and otolith weights, you would upload a data file in this panel with specified format. Then you would be able to choose a model to fit ages and otolith weights.",auto,tab1
2,#age_len_upload,"What if you don't need a relationship between ages and otolith weight? Suppose that you already have multiple reads for ages and you just need to fit ages with lengths, then you would start from this panel and upload a data file with specified format.",auto,tab1
3,#oto_age_controls,"Now you have uploaded a file that contains otolith weights and ages information, you should see your input data on the right hand side. Then in this control panel, you would choose what kind of model you think that best fits ages and otolith weights and carefully choose starting values. When you press the button, you would see the model run result in Summary & Plot tab.",auto,tab2-1
4,#step1-3,"Now you have the model, you should see the predicted ages in this tab. You can then press the button to confirm that you want to use these ages and lengths for a growth curve analysis and this would take you to the Length vs. Age tab.",auto,tab2-1-3
5,#oto_model_upload,"Instead of running a new Age vs. Weight model, you can upload a model (must be of class 'lm') of your choosing and use it to predict ages.",auto,tab2-2
6,#step1-5,"Similarly as in a previous step, pressing the button will confirm your data choice for growth curve analysis.",auto,tab2-2
7,#step2-2,Now you are in Length vs. Age tab. You got to this tab either because you have just run an Age vs. Otolith Weight analysis or you directly uploaded a data file that contains age and length information in the right-hand side panel in file upload tab. You should see your input here in this area and you can also filter it as you like.,auto,tab3-1
8,#step2-3,In this tab you will find a scatterplot and a data table from the data you have just filtered in the previous step. Then you can run a growth curve analysis with this data!,auto,tab3-2
9,#age_len_std_control,"No matter if you want to run a growth model with or without random effects, you start from a control panel like this. Carefully select your desired model and starting values for inputs. Press the button to run a growth model and then a scatter plot of your data and the fitting curve will appear on the right hand side.",auto,tab4-1
10,#age_len_re_control,"Sometimes you may want to incorporate random effects in your model, then you will start from this control panel. Similarly, a scatter plot and a fitting curve will appear on the right hand side.",auto,tab4-2
11,#z_value_control,"With random effects model, you may want to calcute the natural mortality rate from the model. Here you would select two bars from the histogram produced from the model run and use the slope of the two bar coordinates as the natural mortality rate.",auto,tab4-2-2
